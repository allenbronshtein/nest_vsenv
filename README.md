# nest_vsenv

For my STU team:

Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed. 

Install nestjs cli by running:

npm i -g @nestjs/cli

You can start new project and just copy the relavent parts from launch.json

Or you can just download the env from here

If you choose to create your own local env just run:

nest new project-name, and dont forget to add missing fields in launch.json
  
it will enable you to breakpoint and debug
